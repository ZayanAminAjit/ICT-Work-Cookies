        <p>In a microwave-safe mug or small bowl, melt the butter in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds until it's melted but not boiling.<br>
            Stir in the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, and salt until well combined.<br>
            Add the flour and mix until a dough forms.<br>
            Fold in the chocolate chips.<br>
            Flatten the dough slightly in the mug or bowl.<br>
            Microwave on high for about 40-60 seconds, depending on the wattage of your microwave. Keep an eye on it to avoid overcooking.<br>
